                You are sizing up SonarQube findings %s. Produce a compact situational report — no fixes yet, just shape and scale.

                All tool names below (`listComponents`, `getProjectIssuesSummary`, `listHotspots`, `listIssues`) refer to the Sonar MCP server's tools;
                your tool list shows them with a server-specific prefix (e.g. `mcp__<server>__getProjectIssuesSummary`) — map the short
                names to that prefixed form.

                Parameters resolved for this run:
                - %s
                - %s
                - %s

                %s

                Steps (perform in this order):
                1. If a target path/package/module was provided, resolve it before issue calls:
                   - If it already contains `:`, treat it as an exact Sonar component key and use it as `componentKeys`.
                   - Otherwise call `listComponents`; for package names convert dots to slashes and match returned `path` suffixes.
                   - If multiple unrelated components match, stop and ask the user which module/path to use. Do not scan the whole project.
                   - If no component matches, stop and say the Sonar component could not be resolved.
                2. Call `getProjectIssuesSummary` with the resolved `componentKeys` and branch/PR parameters above. This returns total open-issue count and per-facet
                   `[{value, count}]` arrays for severity, type, status, rule, tag, and SCM author. This is your primary signal.
                3. Call `listHotspots` once. If you resolved a file component, pass its `path` as `files`; if you resolved a directory/module,
                   pass its `path` as `path` for hotspots only. Read at most the first page — you only need a count and a sample of categories.
                4. If step 2 returned >0 issues, call `listIssues` ONCE with the same resolved `componentKeys`, limit=20, sorted naturally by Sonar
                   (no extra filters), purely to learn which files are most affected. Group the returned `componentPath` values to
                   produce a top-N file list. Do not paginate further — this is a brief.
                5. Do NOT call `getIssue`, `getRule`, or `getIssueSnippets` here — that is `fix-path` / `investigate-issue` territory.

                After all calls, produce Markdown in EXACTLY this structure:

                ### Security hotspots
                <If 0: "None.". Otherwise: 1-2 sentences naming the top security categories from step 3, plus the count. No per-hotspot detail.>

                ### Recommended next step
                <One sentence: "run `fix-path` on <path>" if the workload looks contained to one path, or "run `fix-file` on <file>"
                if findings are concentrated in a single file, or "investigate dominant rule X" if one rule dominates, or "run `review-pull-request`"

                You are building a fix plan for SonarQube findings under `%s`. Output is an actionable plan grouped by file —
                each line is something a developer (or you, acting as one) can execute.

                All tool names below (`listComponents`, `listIssues`, `listHotspots`, `getRule`, `getIssueSnippets`) refer to the Sonar MCP server's tools;
                map the short names to the server-prefixed form your tool list shows.

                Parameters resolved for this run:
                - %s
                - Target path/package/module: `%s`
                - %s
                - Severities filter: %s

                %s

                %s

                Steps (perform in this order):

                1. Resolve `%s` to Sonar component key(s):
                   - If it already contains `:`, treat it as an exact Sonar component key and use it as `componentKeys`.
                   - Otherwise call `listComponents`; for package names convert dots to slashes and match returned `path` suffixes.
                   - If multiple unrelated components match, stop and ask the user which module/path to use.
                   - If no component matches, stop and say the Sonar component could not be resolved.

                2. Page through `listIssues` with the resolved `componentKeys`%s and the scope parameters above until you have ALL open issues.
                   Use limit=100 per page. Stop when a page returns fewer than `limit` items. Do NOT paginate past 10 pages — if
                   there are >1000 issues in this component scope, stop and tell the user the scope is too broad; recommend narrowing.

                3. Call `listHotspots` once. If you resolved a file component, pass its `path` as `files`; if you resolved a directory/module,
                   pass its `path` as `path` for hotspots only. Single page is fine — you only need to surface a count and a few categories.

                4. From the issues you collected, build the SET of unique rule keys. For EACH unique key call `getRule` once.
                   These responses give you `howToFix`, `rootCause`, and severity context that drive the recommendations below.

                5. Use `getIssueSnippets` SPARINGLY — only call it for an issue if EITHER:
                   - the issue's `flows`/secondary locations point outside the resolved component scope (cross-file impact you must flag), OR
                   - you cannot read the file locally for some reason.
                   Otherwise rely on reading the file directly with your filesystem tools — it's faster and gives full context.

                6. Do NOT call `getIssue` per-issue. The list response already has enough fields (rule, severity, message, line,
                   textRange, flows). `getIssue` is for the `investigate-issue` workflow.

                After all calls, produce Markdown in EXACTLY this structure:

                ## Fix plan — `%s`
                **Scope:** <projectKey>%s%s%s
                **Issues:** <total open> | **Hotspots:** <count> | **Unique rules:** <count>

                ### Common fix patterns
                <For each rule that appears >=3 times across the issues, ONE paragraph (2-4 sentences) distilling the rule's
                `howToFix` into a concrete instruction tailored to this codebase. Skip rules that appear once or twice — they go
                inline below. Format each as "**rule:key** (N occurrences): <instruction>".>

                ### Files
                <For EACH file with at least one issue, in order of issue count desc:>

                #### `<componentPath>` (<n> issues)
                - **L<line>** — `rule:key` (<severity>): <one-line action derived from rule + issue message>
                - **L<line>** — ...

                ### Cross-file impact
                <For each issue whose secondary flows pointed outside the resolved component scope (from step 5): name the issue, the file it
                lives in, and the OTHER files its fix will touch. If none, write "None — all fixes are contained to this component scope.">

                ### Hotspots (review separately)
                <If 0: "None.". Otherwise list as "- `componentPath:line` — <category> (rule:key)" up to 10 entries. Note that
                hotspots need human review, they are not auto-fixable.>

                Rules:
                - Recommendations must be concrete and code-actionable ("replace `==` with `.equals()` on line 42"), not paraphrases of the rule.
                - Quote the rule's `howToFix` only where the exact wording matters; otherwise distill.
                - Do not invent line numbers, paths, or rule keys — only use what came back from the tools.
                - If pagination stopped at 1000 issues, say so prominently at the top of the report.

                - %s

                %s

                %s

                Steps (perform in this order):

                1. Call `listIssues` with files=`%s` and the scope above. limit=100, single page is normally enough for one file.
                   If a second page is needed, paginate.

                2. Call `listHotspots` with files=`%s` and the same branch/PR scope (single page).

                3. From the issues, collect the SET of unique rule keys. Call `getRule` once per unique key.

                4. For EVERY issue, call `getIssueSnippets`. This is mandatory in `fix-file` — the output below quotes the exact line(s)
                   Sonar flagged, and `getIssueSnippets` is the source. Reuse responses for issues that share an `issueKey`-equivalent
                   location only if Sonar de-duplicated them; otherwise call per issue.

                5. Do NOT call `getIssue` per-issue. The list + snippets + rule give you enough for a fix-oriented checklist.

                "None — every issue is self-contained to this file.">

                ### Hotspots
                <If 0: "None.". Otherwise list each hotspot as a separate bullet with line, category, rule:key, and message.
                Mark them "**REVIEW** (not auto-fix)" because hotspots require human judgement.>

                Rules:
                - Always include the snippet block — the user expects to see exactly the lines Sonar flagged. If `getIssueSnippets`
                  returned no lines for some reason, write "(snippet unavailable)" rather than skipping the bullet.
                - Fix instructions must be concrete and bound to the actual code in the snippet, not generic rule guidance.
                - Do not invent code, paths, or line numbers.
                - Order bullets by `line` ascending.

                You are investigating Sonar issue `%s` in depth. Produce an analytical report with a concrete fix recommendation.

                All tool names below (`getIssue`, `getRule`, `getIssueSnippets`) refer to the Sonar MCP server's tools;
                map the short names to the server-prefixed form your tool list shows.

                Parameters resolved for this run:
                - Issue key: `%s`
                - %s

                Steps (perform in this order):

                1. Call `getIssue` with issueKey=`%s`. This returns the full issue (rule, severity, type, status, message,
                   componentPath, line, textRange, secondary flows, changelog of status/assignment transitions).

                2. From step 1, take the `rule` key and call `getRule` once. This gives you `rootCause`, `howToFix`, resources,
                   and a structured description.

                3. Call `getIssueSnippets` with the same issueKey. You get the primary code window plus snippets at every
                   secondary flow location, including cross-file ones.

                4. Do NOT call `listIssues` or any project-wide tool — stay focused on this one issue.

                After all calls, produce Markdown in EXACTLY this structure:

                ## Sonar issue `%s`
                **Rule:** `<rule:key>` — <rule title>
                **Severity:** <sev> | **Type:** <type> | **Status:** <status>
                **File:** `<componentPath>` | **Line:** <line>
                **Created:** <creationDate> | **Updated:** <updateDate>

                ### What Sonar says
                <The issue's `message`, verbatim. Then 1-2 sentences expanding it in plain language.>

                ### Why this rule exists
                <2-4 sentences distilled from the rule's `rootCause` / introduction section. Explain the underlying risk or code-smell category.>

                ### The code
                <For the primary location: a fenced code block with the snippet from step 3, including line numbers.
                Mark the exact offending line(s) with a `<-- here` comment or a brief annotation under the block.
                If there are secondary flow locations, repeat with one block per location, each labelled "**Flow step N:** `<file>:<line>` — <flow description>".>

                ### How to fix
                <3-6 sentences combining the rule's `howToFix` section with the actual code from step 3. Write as an instruction:
                "Replace X with Y because Z." If the rule offers multiple acceptable fixes, list them as a short bulleted set,
                ranked by appropriateness for this codebase. Quote short verbatim fragments from the snippet where they make
                the fix unambiguous.>

                ### History
                <Bullet list of changelog entries from step 1, newest last. Skip empty/noise entries. Format as
                "- <date> — <userLogin>: <field> `<oldValue>` → `<newValue>`". If the changelog is empty, write "No transitions recorded.">

                ### Risk if left
                <1-2 sentences on what could go wrong if this issue is not fixed, grounded in the rule's risk description, not invented.>

                ### Further reading
                <Bullet list of resources URLs from the rule's resources section, if any. Otherwise omit this section.>

                Rules:
                - Do not invent rule semantics. If the rule's description does not say something, do not assert it.
                - Code blocks must come from `getIssueSnippets`, not be reconstructed.
                - Changelog must come from `getIssue` only; if it's empty, do not synthesize history.
                - Keep the fix concrete and tied to the actual code shown, not generic rule advice.

                You are reviewing pull request `%s` through SonarQube's PR analysis. Produce a structured pre-merge report.

                All tool names below (`getProject`, `getProjectIssuesSummary`, `listIssues`, `listHotspots`, `getRule`) refer to the
                Sonar MCP server's tools; map the short names to the server-prefixed form your tool list shows.

                Parameters resolved for this run:
                - %s
                - Pull request: pullRequest=`%s` (pass this to every tool that accepts it; do NOT pass `branch`)

                Important: PR analysis in Sonar is INDEPENDENT from branch analysis. The numbers you see below describe what
                this PR adds/changes versus its base — they are not a full project scan.

                %s

                Steps (perform in this order):

                1. Call `getProject` with `pullRequest=%s`. This returns the PR's quality-gate status, failed conditions, and
                   key metrics (new bugs, new vulnerabilities, new code smells, coverage on new code, duplications on new code).
                   This is the headline.

                2. Call `getProjectIssuesSummary` with `pullRequest=%s`. Severity/type/rule facets on the PR's new issues.

                3. Call `listIssues` with `pullRequest=%s` and limit=100, paginating up to 5 pages, to collect the actual issues
                   the PR introduces. Stop earlier if a page returns fewer than `limit`.

                4. Call `listHotspots` with `pullRequest=%s` (single page).

                5. From the collected issues, take the top 3-5 most-frequent rule keys and call `getRule` once per key — these
                   feed the "What needs to change" section below.

                6. Do NOT call `getIssue` or `getIssueSnippets` per-issue here. This is a review summary; if a specific issue
                   needs depth, the reader will run `investigate-issue` separately.

                After all calls, produce Markdown in EXACTLY this structure:

                **Coverage on new code:** <%% or "—"> | **Duplications on new code:** <%% or "—">

                ### Gate verdict
                <If FAILED: list every failed condition from step 1 as "- <metric>: <actualValue> (threshold <op> <errorThreshold>)".
                If PASSED: one sentence confirming. If NONE: state that no gate is configured for this Sonar project.>

                ### What needs to change
                <For each of the top rules from step 5, ONE paragraph: rule key + count, what the rule wants, and the concrete
                action the author should take in this PR. Format as "**rule:key** (<count>): <action>".>

                ### Most-affected files
                <Top 5-10 files by issue count from step 3, formatted as "- `componentPath` — <count> new issue(s)".>

                ### Security hotspots (human review required)
                <If 0: "None.". Otherwise list each hotspot as "- `componentPath:line` — <category> (rule:key): <message>". Up to 10.>

                ### Merge recommendation
                <One of:
                - "**Block** — gate failed: <one-line reason from failed conditions>."
                - "**Block** — N new BLOCKER/CRITICAL issues introduced (list them briefly)."
                - "**Request changes** — gate passes but <n> code smells / <n> hotspots warrant fixes before merge."
                - "**Approve** — gate passes, no critical issues, hotspots reviewed elsewhere or absent."
                Choose based on the data above, not on style. Cite the specific signal that drove the choice.>

                Rules:
                - All numbers must come from tool responses, not be guessed.
                - If `listProjectPullRequests` would have been needed to confirm the PR exists but `getProject` already succeeded, do not call it.
                - If `getProject` returned no PR-specific metrics, say so explicitly — it may mean the PR was never analysed
                  (no DevOps integration / scanner never ran on this PR) and recommend that the author trigger an analysis.
